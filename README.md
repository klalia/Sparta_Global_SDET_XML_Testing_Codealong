# XML_Testing_Codealong

This is a fully functioning version of testing an XML file. It has tests that uses loops, to loop through each element in the XML file. By using loops and ensuring all elements of the file are tested it makes the tests more dynamic and reusable. The feature to get the children in the XML file and the content in them, the element_children feature was used and assigned to the XML content in the tag. It was converted to text to link the two together. The gsub feature was also used to replace the Â£ symbols to a blank space when testing the prices of the food in the menu.
